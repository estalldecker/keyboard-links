# Keyboard links

Some links related to my keyboard build and keyboards in general

### My forks
- https://github.com/estalldecker/miryoku_zmk: Now I have this profile, but I'll modify it with some combos because I don't like the default layout for numbers and symbols...I need something more familiar with a dev frienfly setup.
  - [how I fixed the undo/redo issues for win](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/88)
- [Urob timerless mods](https://github.com/estalldecker/zmk-config-urob): Interesting profile, I might steal some ideas from it...the default has 34 keys, so it will require some custom configuration :S

  - [https://github.com/dukendev/corne-zmk-5-colum](https://github.com/dukendev/corne-zmk-5-column): it uses a lot of combos. It seems to have been created from scratch.
      Layout philosophy
      - familiar design for the qwerty alphas
      - convinience is priority and minimal by design
      - uses only 36 keys
  - https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/zmk-keyboards/tree/master/config:
      - mac oriented, combos, I'll take some ideas from here
      - _This is my personal ZMK firmware configuration. It consists of a 36-keys base layout for my 5-column wireless Corne_
